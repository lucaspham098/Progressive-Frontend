This project is a web application that helps you track your workouts and progress. It lets you document your workouts and compare your performance over time, using visual cues to show if you've improved or not in each exercise. With this app, you'll be able to easily monitor your fitness goals and stay motivated to reach them.

New users will first have to sign up and then login. They will have to first populate the exercises page with their desired exercises. Then they will populate the workouts page with their workouts. They will then add the exercises to the workouts. An exercise can only belong to one workout. The user will then be able to load their workout on the home page where they will fill in the fields and press the button to finish their workout. The workout that they completed that day will populate the homepage. The workout history will then be present when the user presses a workout card on the workouts page. Exercise history and the progression data will also be present when a workout with the exercise in it had be completed. Right now the user can only do one workout a day. That will be changed in the future. Future implementation includes but not limited to;
- Animations for smoother user experience
- Dark theme and light theme
- A timer for users who want to document workouts in real-time, allowing them to time their breaks
- Ability to add more than 3 sets for each exercise
